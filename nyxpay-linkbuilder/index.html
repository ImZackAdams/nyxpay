      <h2> About NyxPay</h2>
    
      <p>
        NyxPay is not a service. It is a peer to peer payment protocol that fits inside a static HTML file.
        Open the page, connect your wallet, and move value without permission, without middlemen, without any backend that can be subpoenaed.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <code>index.html</code> and <code>script.js</code> make up the entire stack.  
        There are no servers to hack, no databases to leak, and nothing that phones home. View the source and you see exactly what you sign.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Under the hood, a lean SDK for Solana assembles, simulates, and sends raw transactions directly from your browser.  
        No API keys, no opaque gateways, only straight RPC calls to the chain.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        We do not log. We do not track. We could not spy even if we wanted to, because there is nowhere to store data and there is no "us".  
        Host it on IPFS, GitHub Pages, or keep it on a USB stick inside a Faraday cage; it runs the same everywhere.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The Vercel demo is just for convenience. In real use, NyxPay works fine with no extra infrastructure at all.  
        Fork it, remix it, and sell with it. The code is yours, the margin is yours, the liability is yours.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        If you need approval or support to get paid, Stripe and PayPal is that way. Nyx is for those who have moved beyond gatekeepers.
