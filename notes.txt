Solana Meme Coin Payment Platform (Stripe-like) – Project Notes
Overview
Goal:
Build a platform that allows merchants to accept meme coins on Solana as payment, similar to Stripe.

Core Components:

SDK:
PaymentProcessor: Handles wallet connections, token balance queries, token transfers, and transaction confirmations.
TokenRegistry: Maintains metadata (mint addresses, decimals, symbols) for supported meme coins.
Helius Integration: Uses an API key to connect to Solana via Helius RPC.
Server:
A Node.js/Express server that serves static assets and provides an API endpoint (/api/get-key) to supply the Helius API key.
Current Status
SDK Implementation:
Key methods implemented: init(), connectWallet(), disconnectWallet(), getTokenBalance(), and sendTokens().
Development Environment:
Webpack configuration updated to polyfill Node's Buffer for browser compatibility.
A sample app demonstrating wallet connection, transaction processing, and UI interactions is in place.
Known Issues Resolved:
"Buffer is not defined" error resolved via Webpack’s ProvidePlugin and fallback settings.
Immediate Next Steps
Finalize and Harden the SDK:

Test and refine core functionalities.
Update the TokenRegistry to include accurate data for popular Solana meme coins.
Enhance error handling and logging throughout the SDK.
Develop Merchant-Focused Tools:

Build backend API endpoints for creating payment requests, transaction verifications, and handling webhook notifications.
Create a merchant dashboard for tracking payments, viewing transaction histories, etc.
Improve Developer Experience:

Create comprehensive documentation and usage guides.
Provide a “Quick Start” guide and sample integrations to simplify onboarding.
Security and Testing:

Conduct extensive integration testing on the Solana devnet.
Perform security audits and code reviews.
Set up error monitoring and logging for production.
Strategic Planning:

Perform market research on meme coin usage and adoption on Solana.
Plan a roadmap for additional features (e.g., recurring payments, refunds, integrations with other services).
Address any regulatory or compliance issues as the product moves toward production.
Future Considerations
Package the SDK as an npm module for easy integration.
Gather community feedback and iterate based on developer and merchant needs.
Develop a robust versioning and release strategy for ongoing improvements.
Take your break and come back to these notes when you're ready to resume the project. They should help guide your next steps toward building a complete, developer-friendly payment platform on Solana.
