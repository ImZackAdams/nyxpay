// TBALL Pay MVP Roadmap

// 1. Setup Environment:
//    - Install Rust, Solana CLI, Anchor, Node.js, React, and TailwindCSS.

// 2. Build Escrow Smart Contract:
//    - Anchor contract to hold TBALL payments, release upon delivery confirmation.

// 3. Wallet Integration:
//    - Use Solana Web3.js to connect Phantom Wallet and process payments.

// 4. Basic Merchant Dashboard:
//    - React app for merchants to list items (name, price, description).
//    - Generate payment buttons/links for each item.
//    - View transaction history and confirm deliveries.

// 5. Payment Button Code:
//    - JS snippet for merchants to copy-paste on their site.
//    - Opens Phantom Wallet, processes TBALL payments.

// 6. Testing & Deployment:
//    - Test full payment flow on Solana Devnet.
//    - Deploy MVP with manual item entry and copy-paste integration.

// Future Enhancements:
//    - API keys for dynamic item details.
//    - Plugins for Shopify/WordPress.
//    - Auto-generated checkout pages like Stripe.

// Start by building the escrow smart contract and a basic dashboard for item listings and payments.
