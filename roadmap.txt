Reducing Scope for a Solana Payments SDK MVP
Creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a smart approach for a complex project like this. Here are strategic ways to reduce scope while still delivering value:
1. Focus on Single Token Support
MVP Approach:

Support only TBALL initially instead of multiple tokens
Hardcode the token address and decimals
Skip the TokenRegistry class entirely

Later:

Add multi-token support and registry

2. Single Wallet Integration
MVP Approach:

Support only Phantom wallet
Direct integration without adapter pattern
Basic connect/disconnect functionality

Later:

Add wallet adapter architecture
Support additional wallets (Solflare, Backpack, etc.)

3. Simplified Transaction Flow
MVP Approach:

Support only direct token transfers
Skip transaction simulation
Basic confirmation with fewer retries
Eliminate memo support

Later:

Add robust confirmation strategy
Support for complex transactions
Memo and reference fields

4. Minimal UI Components
MVP Approach:

Provide only code snippets for integration
No pre-built UI components or widgets
Simple status callback mechanism

Later:

Build checkout components
Add customizable UI widgets
Implement theming

5. Basic Error Handling
MVP Approach:

Generic error types
Basic error messages
Simple try/catch patterns

Later:

Detailed error classification
Recovery strategies
Comprehensive error documentation

6. Skip Backend Requirements
MVP Approach:

Client-side only implementation
No server requirements
Local RPC endpoint configuration

Later:

Webhook notifications
Server-side verification
Merchant dashboards

7. Essential Documentation Only
MVP Approach:

Basic README with installation steps
1-2 simple examples
Core API documentation

Later:

Comprehensive guides
Interactive demo site
Multiple integration examples

8. Fixed Configuration
MVP Approach:

Minimal configuration options
Reasonable defaults for most settings
Hardcoded constants where sensible

Later:

Extensive configuration options
Dynamic reconfiguration

MVP Implementation Plan

Week 1: Basic wallet connection and token transfer
Week 2: Transaction sending and confirmation
Week 3: Simple example application
Week 4: Basic documentation and packaging

This approach reduces a several-month project to potentially 3-4 weeks of work while still delivering a useful payment solution for TBALL tokens.
